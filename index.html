         <h2>About Star Stuff Counseling PLLC</h2>
         <p>Carl Sagan once wrote, “The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our
         apple pie were all in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of star stuff.” We humans are awe-inspiring and
         complicated creatures and are all connected in this amazing galaxy. However, sometimes we forget how awesome we are. We
         can feel disconnected and lonely. We can face trauma or other life challenges that make us forget our true selves.
         Therapy can be a good thing as it can help us connect back to our true selves (our North Star) and help us feel more
         connected and grounded. This allows us to see life through a clearer lens and helps us process our experiences in a
         calmer state of mind.</p>

         <p>I started Star Stuff counseling to hold space for and accompany clients on their journey in finding their North Star.</p>
         <br>
         <p>I look at family dynamics and inner child attachement as a source of healing. I was adopted as a child and met my bio family later in life; this helped me see these things through an uncommon lens.</p>
         <br>
         <p>Living abroad for two years with my family helped me see life outside of the American bubble and realize how
         interconnected we, as humans, are. Interconnected neurobiology helped me understand this experience.</p>
         <br>
         <p>My experience as a high school teacher, special education coach, and a person with autoimmune issues has helped me learn how to
         navigate 504, IEPs, work disability, and medical gaslighting. I learned to advocate for and give tools to my clients so
         they could advocate for themselves and truly feel empowered to tackle what life throws at them.</p>
         
         <br>
         <p>As a neurodiverse person, I see the world through a different lens. I can see each person's unique qualities not based
         on diagnosis or problems they have, but based on what goals they have for themselves.</p>
         <br>
         <p>Life is hard, Complex traumas and figuring out how to navigate relationships, work, grades, family dynamics, and health
         requires lots of attention. Tools such as EMDR, Inner child attachment, somatic movement, interpersonal nuerobiology and
         narratives are some of the ways to creatively work through life challenges. I see counseling as a unique and creative
         way to shift obstacles.</p>
         <br>
         <p>I am not your typical therapist, I will laugh, cry and I will be human with you. We are all in this together…</p>

            <p>We are all human and life happens. I am more than happy to work with you if you need to reschedule, please just
            communicate with me 48 hours before if you can. If it becomes a problem I will have to charge for $50 for no shows/no
            communication. Also, because others are trying to seek help too I need to be mindful of time slots for sessions. Five no
            shows results in a cancelation of services.</p>
