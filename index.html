         </div>
         <p>Carl Sagan once wrote, “The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our
         apple pie were all in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of star stuff.” We humans are awe-inspiring and
         complicated creatures and are all connected in this amazing galaxy. However, sometimes we forget how awesome we are. We
         can feel disconnected and lonely. We can face trauma or other life challenges that make us forget our true selves.
         Therapy can be a good thing as it can help us connect back to our true selves (our North Star) and help us feel more
         connected and grounded. This allows us to see life through a clearer lens and helps us process our experiences in a
         calmer state of mind.</p>

            <div class='panel'>
               <p>Individual therapy is a one-on-one session with a therapist. This is a safe space to explore your thoughts,
                  feelings, and behaviors. Individual therapy can help you work through past traumas, current stressors, and

            <button class='accordion'><img class="staricon" src="stars3.png" alt="star icon" />EMDR</button>
            <div class='panel'>
               <p>Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a proven, effective therapy that
               helps people heal from trauma and other deeply distressing life experiences. Backed by
               extensive research, EMDR is particularly effective for treating conditions like PTSD, anxiety, and
               emotional pain related to past events.
               <br><br>
               Unlike traditional talk therapy, EMDR uses guided eye movements or other forms of bilateral
               stimulation to help the brain process and reframe difficult memories. This innovative approach
               helps reduce the emotional intensity of those memories, allowing individuals to feel relief and
               regain control over their lives.
               <br><br>
               Whether you’ve experienced trauma, grief, or stress, EMDR offers a path toward healing and
               emotional freedom.</p>

            <button class='accordion'><img class="staricon" src="stars3.png" alt="star icon" />Attachment Based
               Therapy</button>
            <div class='panel'>
               <p>Attachment theory helps us understand how the bonds we form with caregivers in early life
               shape the way we connect with others throughout our lives. A secure attachment with a
               caregiver provides a foundation for trust, safety, and healthy emotional development, influencing
               how we build and maintain relationships as adults.
               <br><br>
               In the context of adoption, attachment can be especially important. Adopted children may have
               experienced disruptions in early caregiving or transitions that affect their sense of security.
               These early experiences can shape their ability to trust, regulate emotions, and form healthy
               connections with others.
               <br><br>
               The good news is that with patience, consistency, and nurturing, people can foster secure
               attachments. These strong, loving relationships not only help people feel safe and valued but
               also lay the groundwork for positive relationships throughout their lives. </p>
            </div>
            <button class='accordion'><img class="staricon" src="stars3.png" alt="star icon" />Somatic Experiencing</button>
            <div class='panel'>
               <p>Somatic Experiencing (SE) is a body-centered therapy designed to help people recover from
               trauma and stress by focusing on the connection between the mind and body. When we
               experience trauma or overwhelming events, our bodies can hold onto that stress, even long
               after the event has passed. This can lead to feelings of tension, anxiety, or being &quot;stuck.&quot;
               <br><br>
               SE gently helps people tune into physical sensations in their body, such as tightness, warmth,
               or energy, to release stored stress and restore a sense of balance and calm. Unlike talk
               therapy, SE works by helping the body process these sensations rather than just discussing the
               events.
               <br><br>
               By addressing trauma at its root — in the nervous system — Somatic Experiencing provides a
               path to healing that feels natural and empowering. It’s especially helpful for those who feel
               overwhelmed, stuck, or disconnected, offering relief and helping them feel more grounded and
               present in their lives.</p>

            <div class='panel'>
               <p>Interpersonal neurobiology (IPNB) is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to understand the mind and mental
                  health. It is a way of thinking about the mind that brings together knowledge from a wide range of
                  disciplines, including neuroscience, psychology, and sociology. </p>

            <button class='accordion'><img class="staricon" src="stars3.png" alt="star icon" />Narrative Therapy</button>
            <div class='panel'>
               <p>Narrative Therapy is a type of counseling that helps people see their lives as stories they can
               shape and rewrite. We all create stories about ourselves based on our experiences, and
               sometimes these stories can focus on problems or challenges that make us feel stuck,
               overwhelmed, or defined by difficulties.
               <br><br>
               In Narrative Therapy, you work with a therapist to explore the stories you’ve been telling
               yourself. Together, you identify how these stories influence your thoughts, feelings, and actions.
               The goal is to uncover strengths, values, and alternative perspectives that might be hidden by
               problem-focused narratives.
               <br><br>
               By reframing your story, Narrative Therapy empowers you to see yourself not as the problem
               but as the author of your life, capable of making meaningful changes. It’s a collaborative,
               strengths-based approach that helps you take control of your narrative and move toward a more
               positive and fulfilling future.

            <button class='accordion'><img class="staricon" src="stars3.png" alt="star icon" />Acceptance and Commitment Therapy</button>
            <div class='panel'>
               <p>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a modern approach to therapy that helps
               people handle difficult thoughts and feelings in healthier ways while focusing on living a
               meaningful life. Instead of trying to eliminate uncomfortable emotions or thoughts, ACT
               encourages acceptance of what you can’t control and commitment to actions that align with your
               values.
               <br><br>
               ACT is based on the idea that struggling to avoid pain often makes it worse. By learning
               mindfulness techniques and developing psychological flexibility, you can create space for
               emotions and thoughts without letting them control you. This helps you focus on what really
               matters, like relationships, personal growth, or goals that give your life purpose.
               <br><br>
               Whether you're dealing with anxiety, depression, stress, or life transitions, ACT provides tools to
               help you move forward with clarity and courage, even in the face of challenges. </p>

            <button class='accordion'><img class="staricon" src="stars3.png" alt="star icon" />Internal Family Systems (IFS) Therapy</button>
            <div class='panel'>
               <p>Internal Family Systems (IFS) Therapy is a unique approach that helps people understand and heal their inner emotional
               world. It’s based on the idea that we all have different “parts” of ourselves, like the inner critic, the caregiver, or
               the part that holds pain. These parts are like members of an internal family, each with its own feelings, needs, and
               roles.
               <br><br>
               Sometimes, these parts can be in conflict or carry burdens from past experiences, making us feel stuck, overwhelmed, or
               at odds with ourselves. IFS helps you connect with your “Self,” the calm, compassionate core of who you are, to better
               understand and heal these parts.
               <br><br>
               By building a caring relationship with your parts, you can release old patterns, reduce emotional distress, and feel
               more balanced and whole. IFS is a gentle, empowering therapy that helps you create harmony within yourself and approach
               life with greater self-understanding and confidence.
