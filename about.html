      <p>I started Star Stuff Counseling to hold space for and accompany clients on their journey in finding their North
         Star. Helping people find connections with themselves or others is one of the things I love about counseling.</p>
     
      <br>
      <p>I was adopted as a child and met my bio family later in life; this event made me look at family dynamics and inner child
      attachment as a source of healing.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Living abroad for two years with my family helped me see life outside of the American bubble and realize how
         interconnected we, as humans, are. Interconnected neurobiology helped me understand this experience.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Being a high school teacher, and special education teacher, and a person with autoimmune issues helped me learn how to
      navigate 504, IEPs, work disability, and medical gaslighting. I learned to advocate for and give tools to my clients so
      they can advocate for themselves and truly feel empowered to tackle what life throws at them.</p>
   
      <br>
      <p>As a neurodiverse person, I see the world through a different lens. I see ALL people as awe-inspiring, just like the stars in the sky. And see science as a way to explore the world.
      
      I see people from the inside out. The heart first because that is where the connection happens.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Life is hard, and complex traumas happen. Figuring out how to navigate relationships, work, grades, family dynamics, and
      health requires lots of attention when trauma is clouding daily life. Tools such as EMDR, Inner child attachment,
      somatic movement, interpersonal nuerobiology and narratives are some of the ways to creatively work through life
      challenges. I see counseling as a unique and creative way to climb obstacles and overcome them.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I am real just like you, I will laugh, cry and I will be human with you during sessions. We are in this together.</p>

         <div class='panel'>
            <p>First session we meet in person or online. I will send out all information and forms to fill out prior to
               meeting via
               Simple Practice portal. Most of it are consent forms. I have to have consent to be able to start
               sessions.(10 min.)</p>
               <br>
            <p>During intake we will talk about what goals you want to achieve during our time together, dont worry these
               goals can and
               most likely will change, but it gives us a starting point. I will ask you some get to know yoou type
               questions and you
               can ask me questions as well. I like to keep things simple. This is a get to know you phase, it can take
               several session
               before you start to talk to me and that is ok. (60 min)</p>
               <br>
            <p>Sessions can get a little heavy at times, you might want to allow yourself 10 min after session to gather
               your thoughts
               and feelings before transitioning to your next task. I say this just so you can plan ahead for when sessions
               are most
               convenient for you.(50 min)</p>
               <br>
            <p>This is a journey, give yourself time and space to learn and grow.</p>
