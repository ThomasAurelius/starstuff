      <p>I founded Star Stuff Counseling to help clients find their North Star and foster meaningful
      connections with themselves and others.
      <br><br>
      My adoption journey and later meeting my biological family deepened my understanding of
      family dynamics and inner child healing. Living abroad for two years expanded my perspective
      on the interconnectedness of humanity, which I now approach through neurobiology.
      <br><br>
      As a former high school teacher and special education professional with autoimmune
      challenges, I&#39;ve navigated 504 plans, IEPs, medical gaslighting, and work disability. This
      experience empowers me to guide clients in advocating for themselves and overcoming life&#39;s
      hurdles.
      <br><br>
      As a neurodiverse individual, I see the world through a unique lens. I view all people as awe-
      inspiring, like stars, and believe in connecting through the heart. I see therapy as a tool for
      exploration and growth.
      <br><br>
      Life is complex, and trauma can cloud our ability to navigate relationships, work, health, and
      family dynamics. I use tools like EMDR, inner child attachment, somatic movement, and
      neurobiology to help clients creatively overcome challenges.
      <br><br>
      I&#39;m real, human, and present in sessions—laughing, crying, and working together to climb
      obstacles.</p>

         <button class='accordion'><img class="staricon" src="stars3.png" alt="star icon" />What is starting services with you
            like?</button>
         <div class='panel'>
            <p>In our first session, we’ll meet either in person or online. I’ll send all the necessary information and forms
            through the Simple Practice portal before our meeting, most of which are consent forms. Consent is
            required to begin our sessions (10 minutes).
            <br><br>
            During the intake, we’ll discuss your goals for our time together. Don’t worry if these goals evolve over
            time—it’s just a starting point. I’ll ask a few &quot;get to know you&quot; questions, and you’re welcome to ask me
            anything as well. I like to keep things simple, and this phase is all about getting comfortable. It’s perfectly
            okay if it takes several sessions before you feel ready to open up (60 minutes).
            <br><br>
            Sessions can sometimes feel intense, so I recommend allowing yourself about 10 minutes after each
            session to reflect and process your thoughts and feelings before moving on to your next task. This is just a
            suggestion to help you plan when sessions might work best for you (50 minutes).
            <br><br>
            This is a journey, so be patient with yourself and allow the time and space needed for growth and
            learning.</p>
